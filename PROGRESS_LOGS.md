## Session Log

### 2025-01-10 - Documentation Restructuring
**Agent**: Claude (Documentation Expert)
**Duration**: ~1 hour
**Branch**: copilot/vscode1759663404387

#### Objectives
- [x] Fix documentation typo (explaination ’ explanation)
- [x] Create structured project management documentation
- [x] Organize conversation history
- [x] Establish progress tracking system

#### Work Completed
-  Renamed `explaination.md` ’ `explanation.md` (corrected typo)
-  Updated all references in README.md and documentation/INDEX.md
-  Improved sets-createset-post-api.md with better template placeholders
-  Removed obsolete `pendingChanges.md`
-  Created `ROADMAP.md` - Project roadmap with vision and planned features
-  Created `CHANGELOG.md` - Chronological change history
-  Created `REQUIREMENTS.md` - Current functional requirements
-  Created `PROGRESS_LOGS.md` - This file
-  Created `documentation/archive/` directory
-  Moved "HISTORY OF WISHING LIST.md" ’ `documentation/archive/CONVERSATION_HISTORY.md`

#### Decisions Made
- **Archive conversation history**: User wants to preserve conversation history (wishes, requirements evolution) but in organized form
- **Separate concerns**: Vision (ROADMAP) vs. History (CHANGELOG) vs. Requirements (current state)
- **Follow OSS conventions**: Use standard documentation files (ROADMAP, CHANGELOG) for professionalism
- **Two-commit strategy**:
  1. Typo fix (simple cleanup)
  2. Documentation restructuring (major organizational change)

#### Blockers/Issues
- **Previous agent stuck**: The previous agent was in the middle of documentation work but didn't complete it
  - Left uncommitted changes
  - Created large conversation history file (121KB) without structure
  - Empty PROGRESS_LOGS.md file
- **Resolution**: Completed the work the previous agent started, with improved organization

#### Files Created/Modified

**Commit 1 - Documentation typo fix** (5942236):
- Modified: README.md, documentation/INDEX.md, sets-createset-post-api.md
- Added: explanation.md
- Deleted: explaination.md, pendingChanges.md

**Commit 2 - Documentation restructuring** (pending):
- Added: ROADMAP.md, CHANGELOG.md, REQUIREMENTS.md
- Modified: PROGRESS_LOGS.md (this file)
- Moved: HISTORY OF WISHING LIST.md ’ documentation/archive/CONVERSATION_HISTORY.md
- Modified: documentation/INDEX.md (to reference new structure)

#### Next Steps
- Update documentation/INDEX.md to reference new documentation structure
- Commit documentation restructuring changes
- Consider updating README.md to reference new documentation files
- Future: Populate ROADMAP.md with more details from conversation history

### 2025-01-10 - Phase 2 Completion: Code Analysis
**Agent**: Previous Gemini agent
**Duration**: Unknown
**Branch**: copilot/vscode1759663404387
**Commit**: 726bc91

#### Objectives
- [x] Analyze codebase for Phase 2 implementation
- [ ] Document suggested code changes (incomplete)

#### Work Completed
-  Created comprehensive `explanation.md` (but named it `explaination.md` - typo)
-  Analyzed entire codebase structure
-  Documented architecture, data flow, APIs, patterns
-   Left work in uncommitted state

#### Issues
- Typo in filename created confusion
- Work left incomplete (files not committed)
- Created large conversation history file without organization

**Resolution**: Completed by next agent (2025-01-10 session above)

### 2025-01-10 - Phase 1 Completion: CSV Enhancement
**Agent**: Development team
**Duration**: Multiple sessions
**Branch**: copilot/vscode1759663404387
**Commit**: a9f5a37

#### Objectives
- [x] Add CSV input support with flexible column mapping
- [x] Implement mandatory vs. optional field handling
- [x] Add fuzzy matching for file type names

#### Work Completed
-  Implemented CSV upload with PapaParse integration
-  Created column mapping UI with intelligent suggestions
-  Added required field validation (mmsId, remoteUrl)
-  Implemented file type fuzzy matching algorithm
-  Created manual resolution UI for unmatched file types
-  Added before/after asset state comparison
-  Implemented processing results display

#### Decisions Made
- **Use PapaParse**: For RFC 4180 compliance and robust CSV parsing
- **Mandatory fields**: Only mmsId and remoteUrl required; all others optional
- **Fuzzy matching confidence thresholds**:
  - Exact ID match: 1.0
  - Exact target code: 0.95
  - Partial match: 0.7
  - No match: 0.0 (requires manual mapping)

#### Technical Details
- File location: `cloudapp/src/app/components/csv-processor/csv-processor.component.ts`
- Lines of code: 910 (noted for future refactoring)
- Key methods:
  - `parseCSVFile()` - PapaParse integration
  - `suggestFieldMapping()` - Intelligent column mapping
  - `matchFileTypeByTargetCode()` - Fuzzy matching algorithm
  - `compareAssetStates()` - Before/after verification

### 2025-01-05 - RxJS Migration and Helper Consolidation
**Branch**: copilot/fix-5fa98c5d-0390-4ac0-908e-a09eea2c94da
**Multiple commits**: f9ba7e7, ace5727, 0bff4a9, ce86681

#### Objectives
- [x] Replace deprecated `toPromise()` with `firstValueFrom`/`lastValueFrom`
- [x] Create shared RxJS helper utility
- [x] Remove duplicate implementations
- [x] Add verification script

#### Work Completed
-  Created `cloudapp/src/app/utilities/rxjs-helpers.ts` (shared utility)
-  Implemented RxJS 6 compatible polyfills
-  Updated main.component.ts (removed 80+ lines of duplicates)
-  Updated csv-processor.component.ts
-  Created sustainability verification script
-  All 7 verification tests passing

#### Decisions Made
- **Shared utility approach**: Single source of truth for RxJS helpers
- **RxJS 6 compatibility**: Maintain compatibility with Ex Libris SDK (uses RxJS 6)
- **Pattern**: Follow RxJS 7+ patterns but implement for RxJS 6

#### Documentation Added
- FINAL_STATUS_REPORT.md
- SUSTAINABILITY_SUMMARY.md
- documentation/RXJS_MIGRATION.md

## Guidelines for Logging

### What to Log:
-  Development sessions (even if just exploration)
-  Key decisions and rationale
-  Blockers and their resolutions
-  Significant refactoring or architectural changes
-  Documentation updates
-  Bug fixes that required investigation

### What NOT to Log:
- L Trivial commits (typo fixes, formatting)
- L Automated processes (CI/CD runs)
- L Merge commits without additional work

### Best Practices:
1. **Log at session end**, not during work
2. **Be concise**: Focus on decisions and outcomes, not minute details
3. **Link to commits**: Include commit hashes for reference
4. **Update objectives**: Mark them as complete or carried forward
5. **Note blockers**: Even if resolved, document them for future reference
