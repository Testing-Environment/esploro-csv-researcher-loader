# Merge Summary - Main Branch Integration

## Overview
Successfully merged the main branch's new features with the current branch's bulk update and URL validation capabilities.

## What Was Merged

### From Main Branch
1. **New Services**:
   - `WorkflowService` - Orchestrates the complete automated workflow
   - `SetService` - Manages itemized sets for job processing
   - `JobService` - Handles job execution and monitoring

2. **Enhanced AssetService**:
   - `getAsset(assetId)` - Retrieve asset details
   - `getValidFileTypesForAssetType(assetType)` - Get filtered file types per asset
   - `getAssetFileAndLinkTypes()` - Fetch mapping table

3. **Multi-Stage UI Workflow**:
   - Stage 1: Multi-row entry form for asset and file details
   - Stage 2: File type selection (filtered per asset type)
   - Automated workflow execution
   - Comprehensive results display with verification

4. **Updated Documentation**:
   - `API_WORKFLOW.md` - Complete API workflow reference
   - `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md` - Quick reference for changes
   - `UI_CHANGES.md` - UI improvements summary
   - Updated README.md and explaination.md

### From Current Branch (Preserved)
1. **Bulk Update Feature**:
   - Add the same file to multiple assets at once
   - Line-by-line asset ID input
   - Detailed success/failure results per asset

2. **URL Validation Feature**:
   - Validate multiple URLs for accessibility
   - Line-by-line URL input
   - Status reporting for each URL

### Integration Changes
1. **Combined MainComponent**:
   - Merged both UIs into a 4-tab interface:
     - Tab 1: Manual Entry (multi-stage workflow from main)
     - Tab 2: CSV Upload (from main)
     - Tab 3: Bulk Update (from current branch)
     - Tab 4: URL Validation (from current branch)

2. **Enhanced AssetService**:
   - Combined interfaces and methods from both versions
   - All features preserved and functional

3. **Styling Updates**:
   - Added styling for bulk update and URL validation results
   - Consistent Material Design across all tabs

## Technical Notes

### API Compatibility Fix
The URL validation feature originally used `HttpMethod.HEAD` which is not available in the ExLibris Cloud App framework (only GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE are supported). Changed to use `HttpMethod.GET` instead:

```typescript
// Before (doesn't work):
method: HttpMethod.HEAD

// After (compatible):
method: HttpMethod.GET
```

### Build Environment
The project uses the ExLibris Cloud App CLI (`eca`) which is not available in this environment. The code has been merged and TypeScript compatibility checked manually, but a full build should be performed in the proper development environment.

## Features by Tab

### Tab 1: Manual Entry
- Multi-row form for entering file details
- Asset validation before processing
- Smart file type filtering based on asset type
- Automated workflow:
  1. Validate assets
  2. Queue files
  3. Create set
  4. Run import job
  5. Monitor progress
  6. Verify results
- Comprehensive reporting

### Tab 2: CSV Upload
- Download CSV template
- Upload CSV file for batch processing
- Placeholder for future implementation

### Tab 3: Bulk Update
- Add same file URL to multiple assets
- Enter asset IDs (one per line)
- Single file details form
- Parallel processing
- Per-asset success/failure reporting

### Tab 4: URL Validation
- Validate URL accessibility
- Enter URLs (one per line)
- Concurrent validation
- Status and accessibility reporting

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Entry Tab
- [ ] Add single file to one asset
- [ ] Add multiple files to same asset
- [ ] Add files to multiple different assets
- [ ] Verify asset validation works
- [ ] Check file type filtering per asset type
- [ ] Confirm workflow completes successfully
- [ ] Verify results display correctly
- [ ] Test error handling for invalid assets

### CSV Upload Tab
- [ ] Download template CSV
- [ ] Select CSV file
- [ ] Verify placeholder message (not yet implemented)

### Bulk Update Tab
- [ ] Add file to single asset
- [ ] Add file to multiple assets
- [ ] Test with invalid asset IDs
- [ ] Verify success/failure reporting
- [ ] Check all form validations
- [ ] Test reset functionality

### URL Validation Tab
- [ ] Validate single URL
- [ ] Validate multiple URLs
- [ ] Test with accessible URLs
- [ ] Test with inaccessible URLs
- [ ] Test with invalid URL format
- [ ] Verify status reporting
- [ ] Test reset functionality

## Known Limitations

1. **CSV Upload**: Currently shows placeholder message - implementation pending
2. **URL Validation**: Uses GET instead of HEAD requests (API limitation)
3. **Build Environment**: Requires ExLibris Cloud App CLI (`eca`) for full build
