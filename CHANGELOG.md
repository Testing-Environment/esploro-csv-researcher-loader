  - `verifyAssetFiles()` API method in AssetService for detailed file attachment verification
  - Pre-import asset state caching with `CachedAssetState` interface

  - Automatic verification trigger after successful job completion
  - Verification state management in both CSV and manual entry workflows

  - Detailed file verification with `matchType` indicators: `exact`, `partial`, `none`
  - Warning system for verification issues (missing files, partial matches, unchanged assets)
  - Recommendation engine for post-verification actions

- **Phase 3.4: Job Status Polling - Real-time Job Monitoring**
  - `getJobInstance()` API method in AssetService for job status monitoring
  - Real-time job status polling with 5-second intervals
  - Job progress tracking (0-100%)
  - Automatic polling termination on job completion
  - TypeScript interfaces for Job Instance API (`JobInstanceCounter`, `JobInstanceAlert`, `JobInstanceStatus`)
  - Job completion notifications with detailed counters (assets succeeded/failed, files uploaded/failed)
  - 5-minute polling timeout with user notification
  - Terminal state detection (COMPLETED_SUCCESS, COMPLETED_FAILED, CANCELLED)
  - Automatic cleanup of polling subscriptions on component destroy

### Changed

## Upgrade Guide

### Upgrading to 1.0.0

#### For Users
- **New CSV Requirements**: Only `mmsId` and `remoteUrl` are mandatory; all other columns are optional
- **File Type Names**: You can now use human-readable names (e.g., "Dataset") instead of IDs (e.g., "DATA")
- **Enhanced Feedback**: Processing results now show "unchanged" status for assets where no files were added

#### For Developers
- **Breaking Changes**:
  - Custom CSV parser removed; now uses PapaParse
  - `toPromise()` completely removed; use `firstValueFrom`/`lastValueFrom` from `rxjs-helpers`
  - RxJS helper functions moved to shared utility (`utilities/rxjs-helpers.ts`)

- **Migration Steps**:
  1. Update imports:
     ```typescript
     // Old
     import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
     const result = await observable.toPromise();

     // New
     import { firstValueFrom } from '../utilities/rxjs-helpers';
     const result = await firstValueFrom(observable);
     ```

  2. If you created custom CSV parsing, remove it and use PapaParse:
     ```typescript
     import Papa from 'papaparse';

     Papa.parse(file, {
       header: true,
       skipEmptyLines: true,
       complete: (results) => { /* handle results */ }
     });
     ```

  3. Update file type handling to support both IDs and names
     - Use `matchFileTypeByTargetCode()` for fuzzy matching
     - Implement manual resolution UI for unmatched types
