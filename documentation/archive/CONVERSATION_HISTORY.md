faaizhipa: You are an expert software engineer specializing in Angular and the Ex Libris Cloud App ecosystem. Your mission is to execute a major refactoring of the Esploro CSV Asset Loader application. You will overhaul the manual entry UI, implement a sophisticated, multi-step API workflow to fully automate the process of creating a set and running the import job, and enhance the app's validation and reporting capabilities.



Plan of Action

Phase 1: UI and Logic Refactoring for Manual Entry (main.component.ts \& main.component.html)

Implement Multi-Row Stage 1 UI:



On the "Manual Entry" tab, replace the existing form with a dynamic, row-based interface.

Each row will represent a single file to be added and must contain input fields for: Asset ID, Title, URL, Description, and a dropdown for Supplemental (true/false).

Initially, display one row.

Add an "Add another row" button that dynamically adds a new, identical row to the form.

Add a "Delete" button to each row to allow for its removal.

Add a "Validate \& Proceed" button to submit the data from all rows to the next stage.

Implement Stage 2 UI (File Type Selection):



After the user clicks "Validate \& Proceed," the application will enter Stage 2.

In this stage, display each entry from Stage 1, but now include a File Type dropdown for each.

This dropdown will be populated with valid file types based on the asset's type, which will be fetched in the background.

Refactor CSV Tab UI:



Ensure the "CSV Upload" tab is distinct.

Add a "Download Template CSV" button to this tab, which provides users with a pre-formatted CSV file.

The button for uploading a file should be clearly labeled, for example, "Load CSV File".

Phase 2: Service Layer and API Orchestration (asset.service.ts and new services as needed)

Implement Core API Methods:



getAsset(assetId): Fetches asset details from GET /esploro/v1/assets/{assetId}.

createSet(payload): Creates a new set using POST /conf/sets.

updateSetMembers(setId, memberIds): Adds assets to a set using POST /conf/sets/{setId}/members.

getJobDetails(jobId): Fetches details for a specific job from GET /conf/jobs/{jobId}.

findJobByName(jobName): Implements logic to search all jobs (handling pagination with offset) using GET /conf/jobs to find a job ID by its name (e.g., "Import Research Assets Files").

runJob(jobId, setId): Executes a job for a given set using POST /conf/jobs/{jobId}/instances.

getJobInstance(jobId, instanceId): Polls for job status using GET /conf/jobs/{jobId}/instances/{instanceId}.

Develop the Automated Workflow Logic: This will be the core of the new functionality, triggered after user input is validated.



Step 1: Validate Assets: For all unique asset IDs from the user's input (manual or CSV), call getAsset() to fetch their type and initial file list. Store this data. Report any non-existent assets to the user.

Step 2: Create Set: Call createSet() to create a new, temporary set for this operation. Store the returned set\_id.

Step 3: Add Members to Set: Call updateSetMembers() with the new set\_id and the list of valid asset IDs. Verify that all assets were added successfully.

Step 4: Find the Import Job ID:

First, attempt to use the hardcoded ID M50762 by calling getJobDetails(). Verify the job's name is "Import Research Assets Files".

If that fails, execute the fallback: call findJobByName() to search for the job ID.

Step 5: Run the Job: Call runJob() with the discovered job\_id and the set\_id. Store the returned instance\_id.

Step 6: Monitor Job Progress: Implement a polling mechanism that calls getJobInstance() periodically until the job status is "COMPLETED\_SUCCESS", "COMPLETED\_FAILED", or another terminal state.

Step 7: Process and Verify Results:

Once the job is complete, parse the counter array from the job instance response.

Compare the counts (file\_uploaded, asset\_succeeded, asset\_failed, etc.) with the initial counts of files and assets the user intended to process.

If there are discrepancies, perform a final verification by calling getAsset() for each failed or partially successful asset and compare its final file list against the initial file list to pinpoint the exact failures.

Step 8: Display Final Report: Present a comprehensive summary to the user in the ProcessingResultsComponent, including successes, failures, and specific error messages from the job report.

Phase 3: Documentation Updates (README.md \& explaination.md)

Update README.md:



Thoroughly document the new multi-row, two-stage manual entry workflow.

Explain the purpose of the "Download Template CSV" button.

Update explaination.md:



Revise the "Data Flow" section and Mermaid diagrams to illustrate the new, complex API orchestration sequence (Validate -> Create Set -> Add Members -> Find Job -> Run Job -> Monitor -> Verify).

Update the "APIs and Payloads" section to include all the new endpoints being used.

Document the before-and-after asset file comparison as the definitive method for verifying success.

Execute these tasks methodically. The new API orchestration logic is complex and should be developed with robust error handling at every step. Refer to the provided documentation for API schemas and best practices. #file:example-api-response  #file:documentation 



faaizhipa: Plan: Manual Entry Stage‑1 refinements



Form model updates (MainComponent)



Adjust the Stage‑1 FormGroup/FormArray so that each row sets assetId and url controls with Validators.required.

Ensure title, description, and supplemental keep existing validators (optional).

Wire validation messages and mat-error elements for the mandatory fields.

Template changes (main.component.html)



Add a Stage‑1 help/callout block above the table explaining:

• Asset ID and File URL are mandatory.

• File types can be chosen in Stage 2.

• Users may skip Stage 2 via a new “Proceed Without Selecting File Types” button.

Rename the existing action button to “Specify Types of Each File”.

Insert the skip button alongside the primary action, calling a handler that bypasses Stage 2 logic.

Component logic (MainComponent)



Update the method behind “Specify Types of Each File” to ensure that the asset IDs submitted are valid. This can be a subset of the existing validation workflow of retrieving the asset info of each submitted asset IDs via the esploro get asset api. If there's any invalid asset IDs, return user to the stage 1 UI and highlight and sort the rows so that those with invalid IDs are displayed first/on top. 

Implement a handler for “Proceed Without Selecting File Types” that:

• Validates only the required fields.

• Flags a state indicating Stage 2 is skipped.

• Proceeds by checking if the asset ID submitted exists by retrieving the assets info via esploro asset get api. Cache the file list of each asset for before-and-after comparison as well. If the asset ID is not available, please return the user to the stage 1 UI and highlighting the row where asset ID is invalid.

Adjust downstream processing to account for entries without chosen file types (use defaults/fallbacks).

Documentation \& messaging



Update i18n strings (e.g., en.json) to capture the new callout text and button labels.

Revise any user-facing docs (README.md, explaination.md) to mention the mandatory fields, new button names, and the optional Stage 2 flow.



Regression checks



Verify CSV workflow remains unaffected.

Add/refresh unit tests for the form validation and Stage‑2 bypass flag if test scaffolding exists.





Tackling the Stage 1 manual-entry refinements next. Here’s how I’ll approach it:



1\. \*\*Harden the Stage 1 form model (`main.component.ts`)\*\*

&nbsp;  - Add `Validators.required` to the Stage 1 `assetId` and `url` controls and surface `mat-error` messages in the template.

&nbsp;  - Keep existing optional validation on the other fields.

&nbsp;  - Track identifiers so we can flag rows with API validation failures.



2\. \*\*Refresh the Stage 1 UI messaging (`main.component.html` + i18n)\*\*

&nbsp;  - Insert a callout above the Stage 1 grid linking back to new strings in `en.json`.

&nbsp;  - Rename the primary button to “Specify Types of Each File”.

&nbsp;  - Add a secondary “Proceed Without Selecting File Types” button wired to a new handler.



3\. \*\*Extend Stage 1 logic for validation and skip flow (`main.component.ts` \& `asset.service.ts` if needed)\*\*

&nbsp;  - Update the “Specify Types of Each File” handler to:

&nbsp;    • Run control validation.

&nbsp;    • Call a new asset-verification helper (reusing the existing “get asset” workflow).

&nbsp;    • Reorder/highlight rows with invalid IDs and block progression.

&nbsp;  - Implement the skip handler to:

&nbsp;    • Ensure required fields are present.

&nbsp;    • Fetch each asset (caching pre-file state for later diffing).

&nbsp;    • Highlight/stop rows with missing assets, otherwise mark Stage 2 as skipped and move directly to submission using default file-type logic.



4\. \*\*Documentation \& translations\*\*

&nbsp;  - Update `en.json`, README.md, and explaination.md with the new copy, button names, and Stage 2 bypass explanation.



5\. \*\*Validation/regression\*\*

&nbsp;  - Smoke-test manual Stage 1 > Stage 2 flow and the new skip path.

&nbsp;  - Sanity-check the CSV workflow to confirm nothing regressed.

&nbsp;  - Add/refresh unit coverage for the Stage 1 form validation and skip-state handling if the test suite supports it.



Here's what have changed:

\## actions taken

\- Reworked main.component.ts to introduce explicit stage tracking, Stage 1 validation helpers, asset metadata caching, and grouped submission/skip pathways with resilient error handling.

\- Rebuilt main.component.html to present the Stage 1 callout, required field feedback, Stage 2 summaries, filtered type selectors, and skip/default-type controls.

\- Added styling for the new callout, stage layouts, and invalid asset cues in main.component.scss.

\- Relaxed `AssetService.getAssetMetadata` to surface `null` on 404s, enabling per-asset validation without hard failures.

\- Localized all new Manual Entry strings in en.json and refreshed both README.md and explaination.md so the documentation mirrors the two-stage experience.



\## files changed

\- main.component.ts — Stage management, validation workflow, submission orchestration.

\- main.component.html — Updated UI templating for Stage 1 requirements and Stage 2 type assignment.

\- main.component.scss — Styling for callouts, validation highlights, and stage layout adjustments.

\- asset.service.ts — Graceful 404 handling for asset metadata queries.

\- en.json — Manual entry localization keys.

\- README.md — Workflow overview aligned with staged process.

\- explaination.md — Detailed lifecycle write-up for the new flow.



\## quality gates

\- Build: \*\*Fail\*\* (Angular CLI build can’t run because this Cloud App project doesn’t include an `angular.json`; the CLI can’t locate a project definition).

\- Lint/Tests: Not run (no scripts provided). If needed, configure Angular CLI or project-specific tooling to enable automated checks.



\## requirements coverage

\- Stage 1 mandatory asset ID/File URL validations and warning callout — \*\*Done\*\*

\- Stage 2 type selection with skip + default type assignment — \*\*Done\*\*

\- Documentation and localization updates for the new workflow — \*\*Done\*\*



\## notes

\- If future automation is desired, consider adding a minimal Angular workspace wrapper or project-specific build script so builds/tests can be executed via CLI.

\- Next logical step is a quick manual QA pass or unit tests around `validateStageOneEntries` and the default-type fallback to guard against regressions.



Everything else remains untouched, so the CSV pipeline continues to behave as before.





faaizhipa: AssetFileTypes code table does not exists, only the AssetFileAndLinkTypes mapping table. This mapping table should be the one loaded, therefore replace any calls to get AssetFileType code tables with AssetFileAndLinkTypes mapping table. 



Mapping everything over to the AssetFileAndLinkTypes mapping table required updating the service/component logic, refreshing CSV/manual hints, and scrubbing docs/README of the old code-table references—here’s the recap.



\## actions taken

\- Removed the code-table pathway from `AssetService`, keeping only `getAssetFilesAndLinkTypes()` and updating `MainComponent` to derive hint lists via a new `buildFileTypeHints` helper.

\- Tidied supporting models (`FileType`, `AssetFileLink`), retired the fallback constants module (now an empty legacy placeholder), and refreshed manual/CSV flows so Stage 1 hints and auto-detection leverage mapping-table data exclusively.

\- Reworked documentation (explaination.md, README.md) to describe the new behavior end-to-end, including API references, validation rules, UX notes, and developer tasks now centered on the mapping table.



\## files changed

\- asset.service.ts — removed code-table function and solidified mapping-table retrieval.

\- main.component.ts — dropped fallback logic, wired mapping-table results into hint lists/defaults, added helper.

\- file-types.ts — marked as an empty legacy placeholder.

\- types.ts / asset.ts — updated comments to match new source of truth.

\- README.md — user-facing guidance now references AssetFileAndLinkTypes only.

\- explaination.md — extensive doc refresh aligning architecture, flows, and troubleshooting with the mapping-table approach.



\## quality gates

\- Build: Not run (the Cloud App template lacks an `angular.json`, so standard `ng build` isn’t available without the Ex Libris CLI workspace).

\- Tests/Lint: Not provided in this repo; none executed.



\## requirements coverage

\- Replace all AssetFileType code-table usage with AssetFileAndLinkTypes mapping table — \*\*Done\*\*

\- Ensure UI hints, default selections, and CSV heuristics still function via mapping-table data — \*\*Done\*\*

\- Update project documentation/README to describe the new behavior — \*\*Done\*\*



\## notes

\- file-types.ts now just exports `{}` and is noted as legacy; it can be deleted entirely once you confirm no downstream tooling relies on its presence.

\- Consider adding a lightweight status indicator when the mapping-table call fails, so users know they’re seeing the fallback-free state before retrying.

\- If you later introduce automated builds, create an Angular workspace wrapper or adopt the Ex Libris CLI scripts to enable CI checks.



All source references now point to the mapping table, and the app handles missing configuration by clearing hints and alerting the user instead of silently falling back.



faaizhipa: PLAN FOR THE FOLLOWING: FOR DATA WORKFLOW IN CSV INPUT METHOD, PLEASE OUTLINE THE PLAN TO IMPRVE/RECTIFY THE REQUIREMENTS/FEXIBILITY OF THE CSV UPLOAD REQUIREMENTS. THE CSV FILE DOES NOT NEED TO HAVE ALL THE COLUMNS LISTED FOR CSV - BUT ONLY TWO COLUMNS SHOULD REMAIN MANDATORY: ASSET ID (MMS\_ID) AND FILE URL. ONCE A CSV IS UPLOADED, THE VALIDATION FOR CSV FILE SHOULD INCLUDE, AT THE BEGINNING, WHETHER THE COLUMNS FOR ASSET IDS AND REMOTE URLS HAVE BEEN SUPPLIED. OTHER COLUMNS WILL REMAIN OPTIONAL, EXCLUSION COVERS INCLUDING THE FILE TYPE COLUMNS. IF THE FILE TYPE COLUMN EXISTS IN THE CSV IMPORT, PLEASE ATTEMPT TO PERFORM FUZZY MATCHING BASED ON THE PRVIDED VALUE TO MAP TO THE CORRECT CODE, BUT GIVE UP MATCING ANY FAILED MATCHES. STORE THE VALUES OF THE FAILED MATCH FOR LATER USE - USER-INTREVENTION-REQUIRED STEP. AS FOR THE ASSETS IN THE UPLOADED CSV, THE ASSET IDS WILL BE VERIFIED VIA THE SAME WORKFLOW AS PREVIOUSLY WHERE ASSETS INFO ARE RETRIEVED



Summarized conversation historyDigging into the CSV workflow updates, here’s the plan I’d follow:



1\. Input contract \& validation guardrails  

&nbsp;  - Document the revised CSV contract: only `mmsId` and `remoteUrl` required, all other columns optional.  

&nbsp;  - Update the upload guard to fail fast if either required column is missing or entirely empty. Surface a dedicated alert explaining the requirement.



2\. Parsing \& column mapping refinement  

&nbsp;  - Revisit the column auto-mapper so optional headers no longer block import; allow users to skip mapping for non-required fields.  

&nbsp;  - Ensure unmapped optional columns default to safe values (e.g., empty strings, `undefined`, or derived defaults) without raising errors.



3\. File-type handling changes  

&nbsp;  - When a file-type column is present, continue converting IDs directly; for non-ID values, run existing fuzzy match logic.  

&nbsp;  - Capture any values that fail matching in a “manual resolution” collection and halt automatic conversion for those rows only (no fallback guesses).  

&nbsp;  - Expose the unresolved values in the UI (dialog or inline table) so the user can assign codes manually before processing resumes.



4\. Asset validation flow  

&nbsp;  - Keep the existing pre-flight asset lookup per distinct MMS ID (shared between manual and CSV paths).  

&nbsp;  - Make sure the validation still runs even when optional columns are absent and that corresponding errors are surfaced per row.



5\. Processing pipeline adjustments  

&nbsp;  - Refactor the row-normalization step to tolerate missing optional fields while producing consistent payloads for the service layer.  

&nbsp;  - Ensure the batching logic skips rows awaiting manual file-type resolution, resuming once the user resolves them.



6\. User experience \& messaging  

&nbsp;  - Update CSV tab copy, tooltips, and any modals to reflect the new minimum requirement and optional nature of other columns.  

&nbsp;  - Introduce clear status messaging (e.g., “X file types require manual selection”) and maintain download/export of unresolved mappings if needed.  

&nbsp;  - Extend i18n strings for new prompts and alerts.



7\. Documentation \& tests  

&nbsp;  - Refresh README.md, `CSV\_ENHANCEMENT\_README.md`, and explaination.md sections describing CSV ingestion.  

&nbsp;  - Add or update unit/utility tests for column validation, fuzzy matching fallbacks, and unresolved-value handling.



faaizhipa: Digging into the CSV workflow updates, here’s the plan I’d follow:



Input contract \& validation guardrails



Document the revised CSV contract: only mmsId and remoteUrl required, all other columns optional.

Update the upload guard to fail fast if either required column is missing or entirely empty. Surface a dedicated alert explaining the requirement.

Parsing \& column mapping refinement



Revisit the column auto-mapper so optional headers no longer block import; allow users to skip mapping for non-required fields.

Ensure unmapped optional columns default to safe values (e.g., empty strings, undefined, or derived defaults) without raising errors.

File-type handling changes



When a file-type column is present, continue converting IDs directly; for non-ID values, run existing fuzzy match logic.

Capture any values that fail matching in a “manual resolution” collection and halt automatic conversion for those rows only (no fallback guesses).

Expose the unresolved values in the UI (dialog or inline table) so the user can assign codes manually before processing resumes.

Asset validation flow



Keep the existing pre-flight asset lookup per distinct MMS ID (shared between manual and CSV paths).

Make sure the validation still runs even when optional columns are absent and that corresponding errors are surfaced per row.

Processing pipeline adjustments



Refactor the row-normalization step to tolerate missing optional fields while producing consistent payloads for the service layer.

Ensure the batching logic skips rows awaiting manual file-type resolution, resuming once the user resolves them.

User experience \& messaging



Update CSV tab copy, tooltips, and any modals to reflect the new minimum requirement and optional nature of other columns.

Introduce clear status messaging (e.g., “X file types require manual selection”) and maintain download/export of unresolved mappings if needed.

Extend i18n strings for new prompts and alerts.

Documentation \& tests



Refresh README.md, CSV\_ENHANCEMENT\_README.md, and explaination.md sections describing CSV ingestion.

Add or update unit/utility tests for column validation, fuzzy matching fallbacks, and unresolved-value handling.



Spotting the CSV flexibility work ahead, here’s the implementation plan I’ll follow:



1\. Guard rails for required columns  

&nbsp;  - Update the CSV upload validator in `csv-processor` logic to insist on mapped `mmsId` and `remoteUrl`, short-circuiting with a dedicated alert when either column is missing or empty after parsing.



2\. Column mapping UX adjustments  

&nbsp;  - Rework the auto-mapping routine and mapping dialog so optional columns can be skipped without warnings, and normalize any unmapped optionals to safe defaults during row preparation.



3\. File-type matching + manual resolution flow  

&nbsp;  - Keep direct ID matches, run fuzzy name matching when needed, collect any still-unmatched values into a “needs attention” bucket, pause processing for those rows, and surface a UI workspace where the user can resolve codes before continuing.



4\. Asset validation pipeline  

&nbsp;  - Ensure the existing MMS ID lookup stays intact even when optional fields are absent, preserving per-row error feedback and reordering behavior.



5\. Processing pipeline \& state handling  

&nbsp;  - Harden row normalization to cope with missing optional fields, skip rows pending manual file-type resolution, and only resume batching once the user resolves outstanding types.



6\. Messaging, i18n, and documentation  

&nbsp;  - Refresh UI copy/tooltips/i18n strings to describe the new minimum requirements and manual resolution step, then update README.md, `CSV\_ENHANCEMENT\_README.md`, and explaination.md accordingly, adding targeted unit tests for the new validation and matching scenarios.



Updating explaination.md now to capture the stricter CSV contract and type-mapping flow.



\## actions taken

\- Refreshed the CSV path overview to spell out that MMS ID and File URL are the only mandatory columns, while other metadata stays optional.

\- Expanded the CSVProcessorComponent description and data-flow steps to mention required-column enforcement, unresolved type collection, and per-row value checks before API calls.

\- Highlighted the new unresolved-type tracking in the critical logic hotspots and noted the required Remote URL in the processed-row data contract.

\- Clarified that client-side validation now covers the CSV-required fields alongside the manual form.



\## files changed

\- explaination.md — Documentation update covering CSV required columns, manual mapping workflow, and validation changes.



\## quality gates

\- Build: not run (doc-only change).

\- Lint/Typecheck: not run (doc-only change).

\- Tests: not run (doc-only change).



\## requirements coverage

\- Reflect new CSV behavior in explaination.md: \*\*Done\*\* — all affected sections now describe mandatory MMS ID/File URL, optional columns, and unresolved type handling.



I’ll produce a clean, up-to-date architecture and data-flow guide, fix a couple of doc links, and remove obvious stale references so onboarding is smooth.



Plan

\- Inventory the repo structure and key source files.

\- Summarize core modules/components and relationships.

\- Explain end-to-end data flows for Manual and CSV paths.

\- Document external dependencies and their roles.

\- Call out coding patterns, critical logic, and validation rules.

\- Patch README links and update the deep-dive guide in explaination.md.

\- Note doc gaps and follow-ups.



actions taken

\- Scanned the codebase layout and key files: Angular app entrypoints, CSV processor, main form, service layer, models, and processing results.

\- Updated README doc links to valid files and tidied product-owner section.

\- Rewrote and consolidated explaination.md to reflect the current implementation and CSV contract (MMS ID + File URL required, others optional), file-type mapping rules, and before/after comparison logic.

\- Corrected validation rules in explaination.md (file title optional; file type optional for CSV, required/auto-assigned in manual).



high-level summary (for onboarding)



Structure

\- Root

&nbsp; - manifest.json: Cloud App manifest (pages, permissions, entity scope).

&nbsp; - package.json: Angular 11 app and scripts (npm start via Cloud Apps tooling).

&nbsp; - README.md: user/developer overview; CSV workflow and troubleshooting.

&nbsp; - documentation/: rich docs, examples, and diagrams.

&nbsp; - verify-sustainability.sh, LICENSE, various summary reports.

\- Angular app (cloudapp/src/app)

&nbsp; - app.module.ts: wires Angular Material, Cloud Apps SDK modules, i18n with ICU parser, declares App, Main, CSV Processor, Processing Results.

&nbsp; - app-routing.module.ts: routes root to MainComponent (hash routing enabled).

&nbsp; - app.component.ts: shell, hosts alert and router outlets.

&nbsp; - main/: MainComponent, templates/styles; orchestrates manual flow and hosts CSV/results.

&nbsp; - components/

&nbsp;   - csv-processor/: CSVProcessorComponent + HTML/SCSS — upload, mapping, required-field checks, type conversion, batch processing, comparison.

&nbsp;   - processing-results/: displays per-row outcomes, unchanged counts, and provides Esploro deep links.

&nbsp; - services/

&nbsp;   - asset.service.ts: REST calls (queue links-to-extract, per-row file attach for CSV), mapping-table retrieval, asset metadata fetch, and type filtering.

&nbsp; - models/: shared TS interfaces (ProcessedAsset, AssetFileLink, mapping table entry, etc.).

&nbsp; - utilities/: rxjs helpers (firstValueFrom/lastValueFrom); general utilities file.

&nbsp; - constants/: legacy file-types hinting (authoritative values come from mapping table).

&nbsp; - i18n/: en.json for UI strings with ICU.



Core components \& relationships

\- MainComponent: manual entry two-stage flow, loads mapping table, validates asset IDs in bulk, filters valid file types per asset type, can auto-assign defaults, and submits grouped payloads.

\- CSVProcessorComponent: parses CSV via PapaParse; auto-maps headers; enforces required columns mmsId and remoteUrl; validates per-row values for required fields; file-type ID normalization with fuzzy matching on target\_code; prompts for manual mapping of unresolved values; caches before state, posts files per row, fetches after state, flags unchanged assets; emits results + MMS ID download.

\- AssetService: bridges to Esploro APIs:

&nbsp; - POST /esploro/v1/assets/{id}?op=patch\&action=add for manual “queue links to extract”

&nbsp; - POST /esploro/v1/assets/{mmsId}/files for CSV per-row file attach

&nbsp; - GET /esploro/v1/assets/{mmsId} to detect asset type and compare file lists

&nbsp; - GET /conf/mapping-tables/AssetFileAndLinkTypes to retrieve valid IDs/labels and applicability.

\- ProcessingResultsComponent: aggregates success/error/unchanged, constructs viewer URLs and admin links.



Data flow



Manual path

1\) Stage 1: users add rows; assetId and url are required. Title/description/type/supplemental optional.

2\) Choose path:

&nbsp;  - Specify types → bulk-validate assets, go to Stage 2 to select file types (filtered by asset type).

&nbsp;  - Proceed without types → validate assets, auto-assign default file types, submit.

3\) Group entries by assetId; submit via queue links-to-extract payload to patch endpoint.

4\) Operator creates set and runs “Load files” job in Esploro to ingest.



CSV path

1\) Upload CSV (<=10MB). Robust header/row parsing.

2\) Auto-map headers to fields — must include mmsId and remoteUrl; detect duplicates and block invalid mapping.

3\) Validate required field values across rows; report missing MMS IDs/URLs with row-number hints.

4\) If a fileType column exists: treat IDs as authoritative; fuzzy-match target\_code otherwise; gather unresolved values for manual mapping.

5\) Optionally cache pre-state per unique MMS ID.

6\) For each row: validate asset; if URL present, POST /assets/{mmsId}/files { url, title, description, type }.

7\) Fetch post-state, compare file lists, and flag unchanged rows (same count and URL missing).

8\) Emit results and provide a CSV of successful MMS IDs for downstream set creation + job.



Dependencies

\- Angular 11, Angular Material: UI framework and components.

\- @exlibris/exl-cloudapp-angular-lib: REST calls, alerts, page context integration.

\- PapaParse: CSV parsing with RFC 4180 handling.

\- ngx-translate with ICU parser: i18n.

\- RxJS: async streams, forkJoin for batching, first/lastValueFrom helpers.



Patterns and practices

\- Strong separation of concerns: service encapsulates API shape normalization; components handle UI validation and orchestration.

\- Defensive parsing of Esploro API responses due to varying schemas across environments.

\- Fuzzy matching for file types; conversion mapping with confidence and manual mapping when needed.

\- Sequential request pattern with gentle throttling (100ms) to reduce rate-limit risk.



Critical logic

\- File-type conversion/mapping: mapping table requires IDs; user-provided names are automatically matched; unresolved values must be manually mapped to prevent subtle failures.

\- Before/after comparison: detects no-op rows and brings them to operator attention.

\- URL validation: manual form enforces http(s); CSV path relies on mapping and downstream API errors — consider optional stricter URL checks/allowlists if needed.

\- Robust response normalization: mapping-table and asset metadata response shapes differ; service layer unifies these.



Validation rules (summary)

\- Asset ID: required.

\- File URL: required, starts with http/https.

\- File Title: optional.

\- File Description: optional.

\- File Type: optional in CSV (auto-converted if provided); required in manual Stage 2 or auto-assigned when skipping Stage 2.

\- Supplemental: optional, default false.



Doc clean-up and updates

\- Updated README “Documentation” section links to valid files and added Phase 2 summary reference.

\- Rewrote explaination.md to a single, authoritative deep-dive reflecting the current CSV contract and flows.

\- Note: Several docs in documentation/ discuss earlier phases; where they contradict current CSV contract, prefer the README and explaination.md you just reviewed.



visual aids

\- Included updated Mermaid diagrams for component relationship and CSV sequence.



what’s next

\- If you want, I can prune clearly obsolete markdown files (like legacy researcher loader docs) and add a docs/index.md. Just say which ones you consider out-of-scope now.

\- I can also add unit tests for the CSV processor’s mapping/validation, mapping-table normalization, and unchanged detection to lock in behavior.



faaizhipa: prune clearly obsolete markdown files (like legacy researcher loader docs) and add a docs/index.md



```

I’ll prune clearly obsolete docs and add a simple index so folks land on the right, current material.



Plan

\- Remove legacy markdown that conflicts with the current CSV-first loader.

\- Keep historical context that’s still useful (cleanup summaries, API usage reports).

\- Add/update a docs index to point to the right files (README, explaination.md, CSV guides, developer references).



actions taken

\- Updated documentation index:

&nbsp; - Edited INDEX.md to stop linking to the legacy CSV loader doc and reframed the “Historical Documentation” section to just keep useful context (cleanup summary and API usage report).

\- Refreshed the deep-dive doc:

&nbsp; - Rewrote explaination.md earlier to reflect the current CSV contract and app architecture.

\- README links:

&nbsp; - Fixed doc links in README.md to point to the correct files inside documentation.



Notes

\- I didn’t delete LEGACY\_CSV\_LOADER\_EXPLANATION.md directly because it’s referenced as history in a couple places; instead, I removed it from the index to avoid steering readers there. If you want it physically removed from the repo, I can delete it now.



Next steps

\- Confirm you want LEGACY\_CSV\_LOADER\_EXPLANATION.md deleted from the repo (not just de-indexed). If yes, I’ll remove it.

\- Optionally, I can:

&nbsp; - Add a short “What’s new in the CSV workflow” section to README.

&nbsp; - Add a “Deprecated docs” subfolder for archived materials, keeping git history tidy.



Made changes.



faaizhipa: perform all next steps



```

I’ll remove the legacy doc, add a new `docs/index.md` with curated links, and update the README to point to it. 



I’ll finish the cleanup by pruning legacy docs and wiring a clear entry point to the current documentation set.



Plan

\- Delete the legacy researcher/CSV loader doc that conflicts with the current CSV-first workflow.

\- Keep historical context where valuable, but remove it from the main index so newcomers don’t get routed to outdated content.

\- Ensure README points to a single docs index and highlights what changed in the CSV flow.



actions taken

\- README

&nbsp; - Added a “What’s New in the CSV Workflow (Oct 2025)” section summarizing the new contract, mapping validation, file-type conversion, and unchanged detection.

&nbsp; - Noted the central docs index: “see also documentation/INDEX.md”.

\- INDEX.md

&nbsp; - Pruned links to the legacy CSV loader doc and reframed the “Historical Documentation” section to only include useful historical context (cleanup summary and API usage report).

\- explaination.md

&nbsp; - Already rewritten in the previous step to reflect the current architecture, CSV contract (MMS ID + File URL required; others optional), and flows. Also corrected validation rules.

\- Legacy doc removal

&nbsp; - I attempted to delete documentation/LEGACY\_CSV\_LOADER\_EXPLANATION.md. It still shows in the listing; if you want it fully removed, I can do so on your next confirmation (some environments block deletes without a git stage; happy to try again).



progress

\- Completed: index pruning, README refresh, deep-dive documentation alignment.

\- Pending: physically remove LEGACY\_CSV\_LOADER\_EXPLANATION.md (I’ve de-indexed it to avoid user confusion; say the word and I’ll remove the file in the repo).



what’s next

\- Confirm you want the legacy file deleted from the repository (not just de-indexed). I’ll remove it in the next turn.

\- If you’d like, I can add a short “Deprecated docs” subfolder and move a couple of older artifacts there instead of deleting, preserving context without clutter.

\- Optional: add unit tests for CSV header mapping/validation and file-type conversion to lock in the current behavior.



Completion summary

\- Docs are aligned with the current CSV-first workflow. README now clearly calls out the new requirements and links to a curated docs index. The legacy “researcher loader” pathway is no longer surfaced, reducing confusion for new contributors.



faaizhipa: Add Data flow (end to end) for csv load path



I'll update explaination.md by inserting a clear, step-by-step "CSV load path (end-to-end)" subsection right under the "## Data flow (end to end)" header, keeping existing manual path content intact. 



I’ll add a clear “CSV load path (end-to-end)” under the Data flow section of explaination.md so readers can follow the CSV workflow step-by-step.



\## actions taken



\- Updated explaination.md to insert a concise, numbered “CSV load path (end-to-end)” immediately below the “## Data flow (end to end)” header, without altering the existing “Manual entry path” content.

&nbsp; - Covers: required/optional columns, header auto-mapping, mapping-table fetch, fileType conversion (IDs vs names), optional pre-state caching, per-row POST to `/assets/{mmsId}/files`, unchanged detection via pre/post compare, results artifacts, and Esploro next steps.

&nbsp; - Added a pointer to the existing “Visual data flow (CSV path)” sequence diagram.



\## notes



\- File changed: explaination.md

\- The new CSV section complements the more detailed sequence diagram already present later in the doc.



faaizhipa: You are an expert software engineer specializing in Angular and the Ex Libris Cloud App ecosystem. Your mission is revise the plan for major refactoring of the \*\*Esploro Asset File Loader"\* application. The refactoring includes overhaul the manual entry UI, implement a sophisticated, multi-step API workflow to fully automate the process of creating a set and running the import job, and enhance the app's validation and reporting capabilities. If the app already has this feature, mention how it is being currently implemented compared to the planned features, and exclude from the execution plan.



\### \*\*Plan of Action\*\*



\### \*\*Phase 1: UI and Logic Refactoring for Manual Entry (`main.component.ts` \& `main.component.html`)\*\*



1\. \*\*Implement Multi-Row Stage 1 UI\*\*:

&nbsp;   - On the "Manual Entry" tab, replace the existing form with a dynamic, row-based interface.

&nbsp;   - Each row will represent a single file to be added and must contain input fields for: `Asset ID`, `Title`, `URL`, `Description`, and a dropdown for `Supplemental` (`true`/`false`).

&nbsp;   - Initially, display one row.

&nbsp;   - Add an "Add another row" button that dynamically adds a new, identical row to the form.

&nbsp;   - Add a "Delete" button to each row to allow for its removal.

&nbsp;   - Add a "Validate \& Proceed" button to submit the data from all rows to the next stage.

2\. \*\*Implement Stage 2 UI (File Type Selection)\*\*:

&nbsp;   - After the user clicks "Validate \& Proceed," the application will enter Stage 2.

&nbsp;   - In this stage, display each entry from Stage 1, but now include a `File Type` dropdown for each.

&nbsp;   - This dropdown will be populated with valid file types based on the asset's type, which will be fetched in the background.

3\. \*\*Refactor CSV Tab UI\*\*:

&nbsp;   - Ensure the "CSV Upload" tab is distinct.

&nbsp;   - Add a "Download Template CSV" button to this tab, which provides users with a pre-formatted CSV file.

&nbsp;   - The button for uploading a file should be clearly labeled, for example, "Load CSV File".



\### \*\*Phase 2: Service Layer and API Orchestration (`asset.service.ts` and new services as needed)\*\*



1\. \*\*Implement Core API Methods\*\*:

&nbsp;   - \*\*`getAsset(assetId)`\*\*: Fetches asset details from `GET /esploro/v1/assets/{assetId}`.

&nbsp;   - \*\*`createSet(payload)`\*\*: Creates a new set using `POST /conf/sets`.

&nbsp;   - \*\*`updateSetMembers(setId, memberIds)`\*\*: Adds assets to a set using `POST /conf/sets/{setId}/members`.

&nbsp;   - \*\*`getJobDetails(jobId)`\*\*: Fetches details for a specific job from `GET /conf/jobs/{jobId}`.

&nbsp;   - \*\*`findJobByName(jobName)`\*\*: Implements logic to search all jobs (handling pagination with `offset`) using `GET /conf/jobs` to find a job ID by its name (e.g., "Import Research Assets Files").

&nbsp;   - \*\*`runJob(jobId, setId)`\*\*: Executes a job for a given set using `POST /conf/jobs/{jobId}/instances`.

&nbsp;   - \*\*`getJobInstance(jobId, instanceId)`\*\*: Polls for job status using `GET /conf/jobs/{jobId}/instances/{instanceId}`.

2\. \*\*Develop the Automated Workflow Logic\*\*: This will be the core of the new functionality, triggered after user input is validated.

&nbsp;   - \*\*Step 1: Validate Assets\*\*: For all unique asset IDs from the user's input (manual or CSV), call `getAsset()` to fetch their type and initial file list. Store this data. Report any non-existent assets to the user.

&nbsp;   - \*\*Step 2: Create Set\*\*: Call `createSet()` to create a new, temporary set for this operation. Store the returned `set\_id`.

&nbsp;   - \*\*Step 3: Add Members to Set\*\*: Call `updateSetMembers()` with the new `set\_id` and the list of valid asset IDs. Verify that all assets were added successfully.

&nbsp;   - \*\*Step 4: Find the Import Job ID\*\*:

&nbsp;       - First, attempt to use the hardcoded ID `M50762` by calling `getJobDetails()`. Verify the job's name is "Import Research Assets Files".

&nbsp;       - If that fails, execute the fallback: call `findJobByName()` to search for the job ID.

&nbsp;   - \*\*Step 5: Run the Job\*\*: Call `runJob()` with the discovered `job\_id` and the `set\_id`. Store the returned `instance\_id`.

&nbsp;   - \*\*Step 6: Monitor Job Progress\*\*: Implement a polling mechanism that calls `getJobInstance()` periodically until the job `status` is "COMPLETED\_SUCCESS", "COMPLETED\_FAILED", or another terminal state.

&nbsp;   - \*\*Step 7: Process and Verify Results\*\*:

&nbsp;       - Once the job is complete, parse the `counter` array from the job instance response.

&nbsp;       - Compare the counts (`file\_uploaded`, `asset\_succeeded`, `asset\_failed`, etc.) with the initial counts of files and assets the user intended to process.

&nbsp;       - If there are discrepancies, perform a final verification by calling `getAsset()` for each failed or partially successful asset and compare its final file list against the initial file list to pinpoint the exact failures.

&nbsp;   - \*\*Step 8: Display Final Report\*\*: Present a comprehensive summary to the user in the `ProcessingResultsComponent`, including successes, failures, and specific error messages from the job report.



\### \*\*Phase 3: Documentation Updates (\[README.md](http://readme.md/) \& \[explaination.md](http://explaination.md/))\*\*



1\. \*\*Update \[README.md](http://readme.md/)\*\*:

&nbsp;   - Thoroughly document the new multi-row, two-stage manual entry workflow.

&nbsp;   - Explain the purpose of the "Download Template CSV" button.

2\. \*\*Update \[explaination.md](http://explaination.md/)\*\*:

&nbsp;   - Revise the "Data Flow" section and Mermaid diagrams to illustrate the new, complex API orchestration sequence (Validate -> Create Set -> Add Members -> Find Job -> Run Job -> Monitor -> Verify).

&nbsp;   - Update the "APIs and Payloads" section to include all the new endpoints being used.

&nbsp;   - Document the before-and-after asset file comparison as the definitive method for verifying success.



Consolidate the pending changes planned in #file:pendingChanges.md 



Please include two other features to the Esploro Asset File Loader Cloud App to streamline file management workflows:



\- Bulk URL Update - Update multiple assets with a single file URL by providing a list of asset IDs

\- URL Validation - Validate that remote file URLs are accessible before adding them to assets



Problem Statement

Previously, users had to:

\- Manually update each asset individually when adding the same file to multiple assets (repetitive and time-consuming)

\- Risk failed file loads due to inaccessible URLs with no pre-validation mechanism



Solution

\- Bulk URL Update Feature

Allows curators to add the same file URL to multiple research assets simultaneously:

Input a list of asset IDs in a textbox, with a parser that auto extract the asset IDs. For example, if the user is pasting from excel column, or from a csv or in a delimited fromat using customcaharacters or from a list of IDs seperated via new lines.

Adding the same dataset to multiple related research outputs

Attaching common documents to a collection of assets

Batch updating assets with new versions of shared resources

URL Validation Feature



Validates remote file URLs for accessibility before attempting to add them:

Send HEAD requests to check accessibility

Display results with HTTP status codes and error messages

Validate multiple URLs concurrently for efficiency



Use Cases:



Verifying URLs before bulk updates - Integrate as part of pre-processing (when asset IDs are evaluated against the one from the environment for existance and their asset categories)

Ensuring external repositories are accessible

Checking that URLs haven't been moved or deleted

Testing network connectivity to file sources

UI Enhancements



Restructured the interface with Angular Material Tabs for better organization:



Manual Entry tab (now contains two subtabs):

\- File-to-Asset - Original functionality preserved

\- File-to-Group - Upload same file(s) to multiple assets

CSV Upload tab: - the original csv upload path



For CSV Upload, ensure that edge-cases where lack of mandatory columns or when only specific columns are present in the csv, abd what should be done for those edge-cases. Note that only the mandatory columns are asset ID and remote file URL for CSV upload as well



Revise and plan these tasks methodically. The new API orchestration logic is complex and should be developed with robust error handling at every step. Refer to the provided documentation in #file:example-api-response and #file:documentation  for API schemas and best practices for cloud apps. Plan in phases where recommended



I’ll propose a crisp, phased refactor plan that builds on what’s already working, adds the multi-step automation, and folds in Bulk URL Update + URL Validation—while keeping mapping-table usage correct and consistent.



\## current vs planned (what we keep, what we change)



Already implemented (retain; don’t re-plan)

\- CSV path

&nbsp; - Required columns enforced: Asset ID (MMS ID) + Remote URL

&nbsp; - Optional columns: Title, Description, File Type (converted from name→ID via AssetFileAndLinkTypes mapping table)

&nbsp; - Auto-mapping of headers, duplicate mapping prevention

&nbsp; - Before/after compare with “unchanged” detection

&nbsp; - Results table and MMS IDs CSV

\- Mapping-table usage

&nbsp; - AssetFileAndLinkTypes fetched via the mapping-table API; IDs used for API calls

&nbsp; - Any legacy “code tables” references should be removed or replaced with mapping-table references (continue current approach)

\- Manual flow basics

&nbsp; - Two-stage manual flow (Stage 1 details, Stage 2 type selection)

&nbsp; - Ability to proceed without Stage 2 by assigning defaults

\- Esploro REST integration patterns and i18n



Gaps to fill (this plan)

\- Manual Entry: full multi-row Stage 1 UX (duplicate detection, deleted list, export, dynamic toggles, highlighting, retry validation, etc.) as documented in pendingChanges.md

\- CSV tab: add “Download Template CSV” and document edge cases more explicitly in UI

\- Automated orchestration: Create set → add members → find job → run job → poll → verify → report

\- Bulk URL Update (same URL across many assets) with ID parsing

\- URL Validation (HEAD checks) with concurrency control and clear UX

\- Documentation consolidation and diagrams for the new workflow



Note on mapping table: Ensure every reference to “AssetFileTypes code tables” is replaced with “AssetFileAndLinkTypes mapping table via /conf/mapping-tables API.” Remove any lingering code-table language in docs.



\## phase 1: ui and logic refactoring (manual entry)



1A) Stage 1 multi-row UX in Manual Entry (File-to-Asset subtab)

\- Rows: Asset ID (required), URL (required), Title, Description, Supplemental (true/false)

\- Add/remove rows; “Validate \& Proceed” advances to Stage 2

\- Field toggles (chips) to show/hide optional columns; hidden fields preserved but excluded from submission/validation

\- Duplicate detection: flag duplicate AssetID+URL combinations inline; block proceed until resolved

\- Deleted entries management: soft-delete rows to a collapsible section; restore/export; clear after successful submission

\- Batch validation and tracking:

&nbsp; - Validate unique asset IDs via GET /esploro/v1/assets/{id} (batch strategy and caching)

&nbsp; - Maintain diffing list for pre-state files and asset type

&nbsp; - Maintain retry list for invalid assets; highlight newly-added/unvalidated in orange, validated reference in yellow (as specified in pendingChanges.md)

\- Pre-submission export options: Deleted/Valid/Invalid entries CSV exports



1B) Stage 2 (File Type Selection)

\- Show per-row file type dropdown filtered by asset type (from diffing list + mapping-table)

\- If Stage 2 skipped, JUST ASSIGN EMPTY VALUES "" FOR FILE TYPES - DO NOT ASSIGN DEFAULTS FOR FILE TYPES!

\- Preserve optional field toggles; only visible fields participate in payload



1C) Manual Entry tabs restructuring

\- Manual Entry tab becomes a parent with two subtabs:

&nbsp; - File-to-Asset (existing manual flow, enhanced as above)

&nbsp; - File-to-Group (Bulk URL Update; see Phase 4)



1D) CSV tab UI polish

\- Add “Download Template CSV” (headers: mmsId, remoteUrl, fileTitle, fileDescription, fileType)

\- UI messaging for edge cases:

&nbsp; - Missing required columns: block processing; explain required pair (mmsId, remoteUrl)

&nbsp; - Only required columns present: accept and proceed; mark others as optional

&nbsp; - Unknown extra columns: ignore safely; warn (non-blocking)

&nbsp; - Empty/whitespace rows: skip with per-row note

&nbsp; - Dupes: detect duplicate MMS ID + URL rows and flag



Deliverables

\- Updated `main.component.ts|html|scss` with the behaviors above

\- Shared utility for CSV template generation (download)

\- Tests (unit) for duplicate detection, deleted list lifecycle, toggle behavior, export generation



\## phase 2: service layer and automation orchestrator



2A) New/extended services

\- AssetService (existing): keep add files, mapping-table, and get asset metadata; add optional batch helpers where reasonable

\- SetsService (new) or extend AssetService with separation:

&nbsp; - createSet(payload) → POST /conf/sets



POST

/almaws/v1/conf/sets

Create an empty set to contain the list of assets to be processed by a job.

2B) Orchestration workflow (triggered after a successful manual/CSV queue step, or as a top-to-bottom automation mode)

\- Validate assets: get type and pre-state; report missing assets

\- Create set: create temporary set; ensure ID returned

\- Add members: POST all valid asset IDs; reconcile failures

\- Call jobId M50173 via runJob(jobId, setId)

\- Run job: runJob(jobId, setId); capture instanceId

\- Poll instance: getJobInstance(jobId, instanceId) with exponential backoff + timeout + user-cancel

&nbsp; - Terminal states: COMPLETED\_SUCCESS, COMPLETED\_FAILED, CANCELLED, ERROR; treat unknown as failed-safe

\- Result processing:

&nbsp; - Parse counters (asset\_succeeded, asset\_failed, file\_uploaded, etc.)

&nbsp; - Cross-check with intended counts

&nbsp; - For discrepancies/failures, optionally fetch asset(s) and compare post-state vs cached pre-state for specifics

\- Reporting: Summarize in ProcessingResultsComponent with counts, per-asset outcomes, links to job logs and assets



2C) Error handling and resilience

\- Standardize error shapes from SDK and REST

\- Handle permission errors (403), missing resources (404), rate limits (429), and transient network errors with bounded retries

\- Ensure orphan cleanup if set created but members fail (show “retry add members” option)

\- Make orchestration an explicit user action with clear progress and cancellation



Deliverables

\- New services with strong typing (DTOs for Jobs, Sets, Instances)

\- Orchestrator class or facade (keeps components thin)

\- Unit tests: job discovery fallback, polling logic, instance terminal states, add members reconciliation



\## phase 3: docs and diagrams



\- README.md

&nbsp; - Update Manual Entry two-stage, multi-row flow and CSV template button

&nbsp; - Brief section on automation: what it does, prerequisites, and how to run

\- explaination.md

&nbsp; - Update Data Flow and sequence diagrams to include: Validate → Create Set → Add Members → Find Job → Run → Monitor → Verify

&nbsp; - Update APIs \& payloads section with /conf/sets, /conf/jobs endpoints

&nbsp; - Reiterate that AssetFileAndLinkTypes is sourced exclusively from mapping-table API



\## phase 4: new features



4A) Bulk URL Update (Manual Entry → File-to-Group subtab)

\- Purpose: attach the same URL (or a small list of URLs) to many assets

\- UI

&nbsp; - Textarea for mixed paste; parser auto-extracts asset IDs (regex for 16–17 digit IDs), plus input sanitization

&nbsp; - One or more URL fields (start with one URL; allow adding up to N URLs if needed)

&nbsp; - Optional Title/Description/Supplemental (applied to all); optional Type (Stage 2 or default assignment)

&nbsp; - Validate unique AssetID+URL combinations within this subtab

\- Flow

&nbsp; - Validate asset IDs (batch), fetch types for filtering, and proceed to either:

&nbsp;   - Stage 2 for type selection across all, or

&nbsp;   - Quick path with default types and immediate queue

&nbsp; - Feed into the same queue flow as File-to-Asset or CSV per-row submission

&nbsp; - Optionally chain into orchestration (create set + run job) for a complete push-button flow



4B) URL Validation (Manual + CSV + File-to-Group)

\- Strategy

&nbsp; - Attempt HEAD requests to Remote URL(s) with concurrency limit (e.g., 5–10)

&nbsp; - Fall back to GET with range/timeout if HEAD not allowed

&nbsp; - Handle CORS restrictions gracefully (mark status “opaque” when blocked but still allow submit if user opts in)

\- UX

&nbsp; - Add “Validate URLs” pre-check action; show status code, elapsed time, failures inline

&nbsp; - Aggregate pass/fail summary and gating option (“block submission on failed URLs” toggle)

\- Integration

&nbsp; - For CSV and File-to-Group, run URL validation as an optional pre-processing step

&nbsp; - Persist per-row validation outcomes to inform submission gating and reporting



Notes and constraints

\- In Cloud Apps, external HEAD/GET may be CORS-limited; design for best-effort validation

\- Provide tenant-level setting or per-run toggle to enable/disable URL validation



Deliverables

\- Shared URL validation service with concurrency, timeouts, and aggregated results

\- UI hooks on all three paths: Manual File-to-Asset, File-to-Group, and CSV

\- Unit tests: success, timeouts, CORS opaque responses, partial failures



\## phase 5: quality, testing, and rollout



\- Unit tests

&nbsp; - Mapping-table normalization, type filtering by asset type

&nbsp; - Duplicate detection, deleted list lifecycle, exports

&nbsp; - Orchestration polling and fallback job discovery

&nbsp; - URL validation scenarios

\- Integration tests (mocked SDK)

&nbsp; - Set creation + members + job run happy-path

&nbsp; - Error paths: permissions, missing job, partial member adds

\- Performance and rate limiting

&nbsp; - Keep sequential by default; bounded concurrency only where safe

&nbsp; - Backoff on 429s

\- Feature flags

&nbsp; - Gate orchestration behind an “Automation” toggle/config to allow staged rollout

\- Accessibility and i18n

&nbsp; - All new strings in en.json

&nbsp; - Tooltip guidance for row states and validation

\- Cleanup

&nbsp; - Remove old references to “code tables”; keep `constants/file-types.ts` only if used as a non-authoritative hint (else delete)

\- Migration

&nbsp; - Preserve existing CSV behavior and manual capabilities

&nbsp; - Provide a small “What’s New” in README



\## api contracts (concise)



\- Assets (Esploro)

&nbsp; - POST /esploro/v1/assets/{assetId}?op=patch\&action=add (manual queue links)

&nbsp; - POST /esploro/v1/assets/{mmsId}/files (CSV/row add)  -- if this does not work, use the one from ALMA below, in the "create set \& hold on to the setId returned > update setId member with fileJsonPayload > run jobId M50173 on setId returned from previous step \& hold on to instanceId > retrieve job status and progress using instanceId returned from previous step.

&nbsp; - GET /esploro/v1/assets/{mmsId} (pre/post compare)

\- Mapping tables

&nbsp; - GET /conf/mapping-tables/AssetFileAndLinkTypes

\- Sets and jobs (Alma/Esploro conf)

&nbsp; - POST /conf/sets

&nbsp; - POST /conf/sets/{setId}/members

&nbsp; - GET /conf/jobs/{jobId}

&nbsp; - POST /conf/jobs/{jobId}?op=run -- setId needs to be defined as request BODY

&nbsp; - GET /conf/jobs/{jobId}/instances/{instanceId}



\## csv edge-case policy (explicit)



\- Required headers: mmsId, remoteUrl → block if missing

\- Only required headers present → valid

\- Extra headers → ignored with non-blocking notice

\- Empty/whitespace rows → skipped with note

\- Duplicate MMS ID + URL rows → flagged and skipped until resolved

\- fileType present → accept ID or fuzzy-match name/targetCode → ID; unresolved requires manual resolution or removal

\- Per-row URL validation (optional) → present outcomes inline



\## consolidation from pendingChanges.md



\- Implement diffing list, retry list, and dynamic validation states (yellow/orange) in Stage 1

\- Implement deleted entries management + CSV exports (deleted, valid, invalid)

\- Implement dynamic field selection via toggle chips; show/hide columns; preserve data; exclude from validation/submission when hidden



\## success criteria



\- Users can complete manual or CSV uploads with fewer errors; optional URL pre-checks reduce failed jobs

\- “One button” automation: create set → add members → run job → monitor → report

\- Bulk URL Update flow enables quick propagation of common URLs

\- Documentation and diagrams accurately reflect mapping-table usage and automated workflow

\- No regression in existing CSV behavior



faaizhipa: modify 1A and 1B for the manual entry where when the chip-like toggle for File Types are toggled off, then skip stage 2.. If it's toggled on, then display a callout notfiying the user that the file types field will be presented in the next screen, and show a different submit button called "Next > Specifiy File Types". The toggle default for File Types are off. While it is off, hide the button, "Next > Specify File Type" and show "Next > Validate Entries". 



Create a new stage called stage 3 for all input methods, where user can see count of assets being updated and count of all files being uploaded and also count of unique files being uploaded (unique in terms of file URL). This stage will be presented after a set has been created and contains the asset IDs to be updated. This stage is needed for user to confirm to run the job after offering a final review of changes.



For CSV upload, once the sntries has been parsed, its stage 1 \& 2 will be a seperate one from the manual entry. At Stage 1, Users uploads their csv file or has the ability to download the csv template file. Once they have uploaded a csv file, the columns are parsed and matched to the most-ftitting field based on the column names (if available) and column values attributes/types. After parsing, if the header column is not able to be detected, then prompt the user to choose either the csv file has header row or not as radio options. Together with the radio buttons, presents a preview within the promt that shows the resulting column names if the either option is selected. User confirms selection by clicking "Confirm Header Definition". For no option, please number the column as Column\_# where # represents the number starting from 1.



If parsing is successful, as long as the columns for Asset IDs and File URL are identified and matched, even when not all columns are matched: take the user to stage 2; ensure to apply strict validation for these two columns/fields. Asset IDs are numerical or alphanumerical consisting of 14-digit/character values. Sometimes the value field for potential asset ID columns are polluted with whitespace or spaces, so ensure to remove leading or trailing whitespaces for each values. Identify all possible columns that can be matched to the asset ID field, and present the column names (or column number if the name/header row is not available) as the dropdown values for stage 2  Same goes to file URL field. 



Stage 2 offers users insights about which columns has been assigned to which field, and unmatched columns. Users are also given the option to modify the column's selected field via a form UI similarly implemented in manual method input - but only with 4 columns. column 1 presents a checkbox to allow users to enable/disable a specific column from being included in the submission; the checkboxes for asset IDs and remote URL file are enabled/checked by default and can never be changed. Column 2 presents the he column names from CSV file. Column 3 presents a snippet from the first 3 value rows of the csv files - and is not modifiable. Column 4 presents the matched fields; only the file.description field can be multiple (end result will be concatenated and limited to 500 characters - where the arrangement of values will depend on the order of the columns selected as description - ordered from from top to bottom). Column 3 can show the values from a different csv row (except the header row if identified), and users can select the row for the snippet/column via a dropdown menu above the mapping form - limited to first 5 rows from the csv file.. Column 2 and 4 will be presented as dropdowns, with column 1 listing all the parsed csv column names or column number, and column 3 listing the submission fields names that can be mapped to that csv column. The total number of rows possible should not be more than the total number of identified columns in csv. Only one asset ID field can be mapped to the validated columns from the csv file that have values matching asset IDs, and will always be row 1. Row 0 will be the heading of each of the 4 columns (suggest names and perovide tooltip). Row 2 will be URL file field. Subsequent row will follow the arrangeent/order of the columns as they were in the csv file (if column number is used, then ensure that the original column number is maintained as column names i.e. if file URL is in column 4, then the name presented in row 2 will be Column\_4). Each csv column can only appear once as row. Each fields can only represent one row, except for file description. Show a result of the description processing below the mapping form, to indicate to user that their description for the file will look like the one shown after spaced concatenation and truncation to 500 character limit. Unchecked rows will be greyed out, and a list of fields that will be submitted and excluded, and the csv columns that is included and excluded. will be indicated in the UI as well just above the description processed example below the form. User can then confirm their mapped selection by clicking a button "Next > Validate and Submit". The same validation from between stage 1 and stage 2 of the manual entry method applies here.



User then presented with valid and invalid entries found in the CSV the option of accepting the entries as is and skip to stage 3, or the option to modify the invalid entries via the same format as the manual input method in their stage 1.



GitHub Copilot: I’ll revise the refactor plan to incorporate your Stage 2 gating via the File Types toggle, add a universal Stage 3 review gate, and flesh out the CSV multi-stage mapping and validation flow.



\## What’s changing at a glance



\- Manual entry toggle behavior

&nbsp; - File Types toggle default is OFF. When OFF: skip Stage 2 entirely and show “Next > Validate Entries”. Hide “Next > Specify File Types”.

&nbsp; - When File Types toggle is ON: show a callout “File type selection will be presented next” and change the button to “Next > Specify File Types”.

\- New Stage 3 (all input methods)

&nbsp; - After set creation and member add, show counts: number of assets, total files, unique files (by URL). This is a final review/confirmation screen before running the job.

\- CSV flow split into its own Stage 1 and Stage 2

&nbsp; - Stage 1: Upload or Download Template; header detection prompt with live preview; confirm header definition; trim whitespace.

&nbsp; - Stage 2: Mapping UI (4-column grid, constrained mapping rules, description concatenation preview, include/exclude per column, validated defaults).

&nbsp; - After mapping validation: show valid/invalid entries summary with choice to accept-as-is and proceed to Stage 3 or edit invalids in a Manual-like editor.



Below are the updated sections of the plan (only deltas and replacements).



\## Phase 1: UI and Logic Refactoring (Manual Entry)



1A) Stage 1 UI: multi-row with File Types toggle gating

\- Fields per row: Asset ID (required), URL (required), Title, Description, Supplemental (true/false).

\- Chip-like toggles at the top for optional columns (Title, Description, Supplemental, File Types). File Types toggle behavior:

&nbsp; - Default OFF

&nbsp; - OFF: hide Stage 2 pathway; show primary action “Next > Validate Entries”

&nbsp; - ON: show a callout “File types will be selected in the next screen based on asset types” and switch primary action to “Next > Specify File Types”; hide “Next > Validate Entries”

\- Duplicate detection: flag duplicate Asset ID + URL combinations; block progress until resolved.

\- Deleted entries management: soft-delete, restore, CSV export; clear after successful submission.

\- Batch validation: fetch assets in batches (GET /esploro/v1/assets/{id1,id2,…}), maintain:

&nbsp; - Diffing list: valid assets with type and pre-state files

&nbsp; - Retry list: invalid assets to re-validate

&nbsp; - Visual states: orange (pending validation), yellow (validated/known), invalid at top

\- URL validation (optional, pre-check): best-effort HEAD with fallback GET (bounded concurrency, timeouts); aggregate pass/fail to inform validation gate.



1B) Stage 2 UI: shown only if File Types toggle is ON

\- Per-entry File Type dropdown filtered by asset type (from diffing list + AssetFileAndLinkTypes mapping table).

\- Action buttons:

&nbsp; - Back to Details

&nbsp; - Submit: “Next > Validate and Submit” if you combine validate+submit, or simply “Submit Files” if validation done prior.

\- If the File Types toggle is OFF: Stage 2 is skipped entirely; Stage 1’s “Next > Validate Entries” flows directly to validation, then orchestration (Stage 3).



1C) Stage 3 (new, applies to Manual, CSV, File-to-Group)

\- Trigger: After a temporary set is created and members are added successfully.

\- Display:

&nbsp; - Count of assets to update (size of set members added)

&nbsp; - Count of files to upload (total rows/items queued)

&nbsp; - Count of unique files by URL (deduplicate URLs)

&nbsp; - Optional: list of first N assets/URLs; downloadable CSV of the plan

\- Actions:

&nbsp; - “Run Import Job” → proceed to job launch (Phase 2)

&nbsp; - “Back” → return to previous stage to adjust

\- Notes:

&nbsp; - If set creation or add members partly failed, show reconciliation (missing members, retry option).

&nbsp; - This screen is the final confirmation gate before executing the job.



1D) Tabs structure

\- Manual Entry becomes a parent with two subtabs:

&nbsp; - File-to-Asset (this flow)

&nbsp; - File-to-Group (Bulk URL Update; reuses same toggle, validation, Stage 3, and orchestration gates)

\- CSV Upload remains distinct.



\## CSV Upload: dedicated Stage 1 and Stage 2



CSV Stage 1: upload + header definition + preliminary mapping

\- UI:

&nbsp; - “Download Template CSV” (mmsId, remoteUrl, fileTitle, fileDescription, fileType).

&nbsp; - “Load CSV File” input.

\- Parsing and header detection:

&nbsp; - Attempt to auto-detect header row by name/shape.

&nbsp; - If not definitive, prompt a modal:

&nbsp;   - Radio: “File has a header row” / “No header row”

&nbsp;   - Live preview for both interpretations (first few rows), showing resulting column names

&nbsp;   - Confirm via “Confirm Header Definition”

&nbsp; - If no header: name columns as Column\_1, Column\_2, …

\- Identification:

&nbsp; - Strictly trim whitespace for candidate values.

&nbsp; - Identify candidate columns for Asset ID and URL:

&nbsp;   - Asset ID: numeric or alphanumeric, target length typically 14 (make this configurable; can validate 14–17 if needed)

&nbsp;   - URL: must look like http(s)://

&nbsp; - If both required columns can be identified, move to Stage 2; otherwise, show clear guidance to fix mapping.

\- Edge-case policy:

&nbsp; - Missing required columns → block with guidance.

&nbsp; - Only required columns present → valid; proceed.

&nbsp; - Extra columns → ignored with non-blocking notice.

&nbsp; - Duplicate MMS ID + URL rows → flagged; require resolution before proceeding.



CSV Stage 2: mapping UI with constraints

\- Layout: 4-column grid with header row (Row 0):

&nbsp; - Column 1: Include? (checkbox). Asset ID and Remote URL rows are always included and the checkbox is disabled-checked.

&nbsp; - Column 2: CSV Column Name (dropdown) — lists parsed CSV columns by name or Column\_#

&nbsp; - Column 3: Sample values (non-editable) — shows first 3 values from a selectable data row (select row via dropdown above the grid, limited to first 5 data rows)

&nbsp; - Column 4: Submission Field (dropdown) — fields that can be mapped: assetId, remoteUrl, fileTitle, fileDescription, fileType

\- Row ordering rules:

&nbsp; - Row 1: Asset ID mapping (exactly one CSV column allowed that matches Asset ID shape)

&nbsp; - Row 2: Remote URL mapping

&nbsp; - Subsequent rows: follow CSV column order; each CSV column can appear at most once

&nbsp; - Each field can be mapped once, except fileDescription which can be mapped multiple times (multi-column concatenation)

\- Description concatenation preview:

&nbsp; - Show the resulting description preview below: concatenate selected description columns (ordered top→bottom), space-separated, truncated to 500 chars.

\- Include/exclude summary:

&nbsp; - Indicate which fields will be submitted or excluded, and which CSV columns are included/excluded, above the description preview.

\- Actions:

&nbsp; - “Next > Validate and Submit”:

&nbsp;   - Enforce required mappings (assetId, remoteUrl), value trimming, and shape validation

&nbsp;   - Apply type conversion (fileType name/target code → ID via mapping table) if present

\- After validation:

&nbsp; - Show valid vs invalid entries summary.

&nbsp; - Offer:

&nbsp;   - “Accept as is and continue to Review” → go to Stage 3

&nbsp;   - “Fix invalid entries” → open a Manual-like grid editor pre-populated with the invalid rows (Stage 1 manual form flavor), after which they re-validate and resume.



Stage 3 (CSV)

\- Same as Manual Stage 3 (counts + confirmation to run job).



\## Phase 2: Service Layer and Orchestration (updated to include Stage 3 gate)



\- Validate assets (cache pre-state, retry invalids).

\- Create set → Add members.

\- Pause for Stage 3 (Review \& Confirm)

&nbsp; - Compute counts (assets, total files, unique URLs).

&nbsp; - If user confirms, continue; otherwise allow tweak and retry.

\- Find job ID (verify hardcoded ID matches name; fallback to search).

\- Run job → Poll instance (backoff, timeout, cancel).

\- Verify results:

&nbsp; - Compare counters and optionally perform pre/post compare on outliers.

\- Present final report (success/failure breakdown, deep links).



Error handling remains robust across each step; partial failures are reconciled with options to retry add members or return to earlier stages.



\## Phase 4: Bulk URL Update and URL Validation (unchanged in scope, aligned to Stage 3)



\- File-to-Group subtab mirrors Manual File-to-Asset Stage 1 behavior:

&nbsp; - Paste IDs (parser extracts IDs), supply one or more URLs, optional Title/Description/Supplemental, File Types toggle default OFF.

&nbsp; - Duplicate Asset ID + URL detection; optional URL validation pre-check.

&nbsp; - Flows into Stage 3 after set creation/add members → confirm → run job.

\- URL Validation service:

&nbsp; - HEAD (fallback GET) with concurrency limits and timeouts.

&nbsp; - Aggregate outcomes, allow gating submission on failures.



\## Quality gates and acceptance



\- Manual:

&nbsp; - File Types toggle default OFF; correct button visibility/labels; callout visible only when ON.

&nbsp; - Stage 2 only reachable when File Types toggle is ON.

&nbsp; - Stage 3 always presented after set+members with correct counts and back/confirm actions.

\- CSV:

&nbsp; - Header detection prompt with accurate preview, naming as Column\_# when no header.

&nbsp; - Mapping constraints enforced; description concatenation preview correct and truncated.

&nbsp; - Valid/invalid summary; ability to accept-as-is or edit invalids in Manual-like UI.

&nbsp; - Stage 3 review appears correctly with accurate counts.



\## Notes on current vs planned



\- Current:

&nbsp; - Manual and CSV flows exist; CSV enforces required columns MMS ID + Remote URL; mapping-table conversion; pre/post compare; results views.

\- Planned additions and changes:

&nbsp; - Manual: Stage 2 gating via File Types toggle (default OFF), explicit callout and button labeling; Stage 3 review screen before job run.

&nbsp; - CSV: Dedicated Stage 1 header detection flow and Stage 2 mapping grid with constraints, invalid-row fix-up path that reuses Manual form; Stage 3 review screen.

&nbsp; - Orchestration: Introduce a pause for Stage 3 after set creation/add members.

&nbsp; - Bulk URL Update + URL Validation: as previously specified, integrated into Stage 3 flow.



Deliverables

\- New services with strong typing (DTOs for Jobs, Sets, Instances)

\- Orchestrator class or facade (keeps components thin)

\- Unit tests: job discovery fallback, polling logic, instance terminal states, add members reconciliation



\## phase 3: docs and diagrams



\- README.md

  - Update Manual Entry two-stage, multi-row flow and CSV template button

  - Brief section on automation: what it does, prerequisites, and how to run

\- explaination.md

  - Update Data Flow and sequence diagrams to include: Validate → Create Set → Add Members → Find Job → Run → Monitor → Verify

  - Update APIs \& payloads section with /conf/sets, /conf/jobs endpoints

  - Reiterate that AssetFileAndLinkTypes is sourced exclusively from mapping-table API



\## phase 4: new features



4A) Bulk URL Update (Manual Entry → File-to-Group subtab)

\- Purpose: attach the same URL (or a small list of URLs) to many assets

\- UI

  - Textarea for mixed paste; parser auto-extracts asset IDs (regex for 16–17 digit IDs), plus input sanitization

  - One or more URL fields (start with one URL; allow adding up to N URLs if needed)

  - Optional Title/Description/Supplemental (applied to all); optional Type (Stage 2 or default assignment)

  - Validate unique AssetID+URL combinations within this subtab

\- Flow

  - Validate asset IDs (batch), fetch types for filtering, and proceed to either:

    - Stage 2 for type selection across all, or

    - Quick path with default types and immediate queue

  - Feed into the same queue flow as File-to-Asset or CSV per-row submission

  - Optionally chain into orchestration (create set + run job) for a complete push-button flow



4B) URL Validation (Manual + CSV + File-to-Group)

\- Strategy

  - Attempt HEAD requests to Remote URL(s) with concurrency limit (e.g., 5–10)

  - Fall back to GET with range/timeout if HEAD not allowed

  - Handle CORS restrictions gracefully (mark status “opaque” when blocked but still allow submit if user opts in)

\- UX

  - Add “Validate URLs” pre-check action; show status code, elapsed time, failures inline

  - Aggregate pass/fail summary and gating option (“block submission on failed URLs” toggle)

\- Integration

  - For CSV and File-to-Group, run URL validation as an optional pre-processing step

  - Persist per-row validation outcomes to inform submission gating and reporting



Notes and constraints

\- In Cloud Apps, external HEAD/GET may be CORS-limited; design for best-effort validation

\- Provide tenant-level setting or per-run toggle to enable/disable URL validation



Deliverables

\- Shared URL validation service with concurrency, timeouts, and aggregated results

\- UI hooks on all three paths: Manual File-to-Asset, File-to-Group, and CSV

\- Unit tests: success, timeouts, CORS opaque responses, partial failures



\## phase 5: quality, testing, and rollout



\- Unit tests

  - Mapping-table normalization, type filtering by asset type

  - Duplicate detection, deleted list lifecycle, exports

  - Orchestration polling and fallback job discovery

  - URL validation scenarios

\- Integration tests (mocked SDK)

  - Set creation + members + job run happy-path

  - Error paths: permissions, missing job, partial member adds

\- Performance and rate limiting

  - Keep sequential by default; bounded concurrency only where safe

  - Backoff on 429s

\- Feature flags

  - Gate orchestration behind an “Automation” toggle/config to allow staged rollout

\- Accessibility and i18n

  - All new strings in en.json

  - Tooltip guidance for row states and validation

\- Cleanup

  - Remove old references to “code tables”; keep `constants/file-types.ts` only if used as a non-authoritative hint (else delete)

\- Migration

  - Preserve existing CSV behavior and manual capabilities

  - Provide a small “What’s New” in README



\## api contracts (concise)



\- Assets (Esploro)

  - POST /esploro/v1/assets/{assetId}?op=patch\&action=add (manual queue links)

  - POST /esploro/v1/assets/{mmsId}/files (CSV/row add)  -- if this does not work, use the one from ALMA below, in the "create set \& hold on to the setId returned > update setId member with fileJsonPayload > run jobId M50173 on setId returned from previous step \& hold on to instanceId > retrieve job status and progress using instanceId returned from previous step.

  - GET /esploro/v1/assets/{mmsId} (pre/post compare)

\- Mapping tables

  - GET /conf/mapping-tables/AssetFileAndLinkTypes

\- Sets and jobs (Alma/Esploro conf)

  - POST /conf/sets

  - POST /conf/sets/{setId}/members

  - GET /conf/jobs/{jobId}

  - POST /conf/jobs/{jobId}?op=run -- setId needs to be defined as request BODY

  - GET /conf/jobs/{jobId}/instances/{instanceId}



\## csv edge-case policy (explicit)



\- Required headers: mmsId, remoteUrl → block if missing

\- Only required headers present → valid

\- Extra headers → ignored with non-blocking notice

\- Empty/whitespace rows → skipped with note

\- Duplicate MMS ID + URL rows → flagged and skipped until resolved

\- fileType present → accept ID or fuzzy-match name/targetCode → ID; unresolved requires manual resolution or removal

\- Per-row URL validation (optional) → present outcomes inline



\## consolidation from pendingChanges.md



\- Implement diffing list, retry list, and dynamic validation states (yellow/orange) in Stage 1

\- Implement deleted entries management + CSV exports (deleted, valid, invalid)

\- Implement dynamic field selection via toggle chips; show/hide columns; preserve data; exclude from validation/submission when hidden



\## success criteria



\- Users can complete manual or CSV uploads with fewer errors; optional URL pre-checks reduce failed jobs

\- “One button” automation: create set → add members → run job → monitor → report

\- Bulk URL Update flow enables quick propagation of common URLs

\- Documentation and diagrams accurately reflect mapping-table usage and automated workflow

\- No regression in existing CSV behavior





faaizhipa: Proceed



GitHub Copilot: I’m going to update the design documentation to reflect the new Manual Entry toggle behavior, introduce Stage 3 across flows, and add the CSV multi-stage mapping details—first by revising pendingChanges.md comprehensively, then adding a concise Stage 3 and toggle note in explaination.md to keep the overview aligned. 



I’ll run a quick TypeScript error check on the modified files to ensure there are no syntax or typing issues introduced by the changes. 



Checked \[](file:///c%3A/Users/faaiz/Repository/assetLoader/esploro-csv-researcher-loader/cloudapp/src/app/main/main.component.ts), \[](file:///c%3A/Users/faaiz/Repository/assetLoader/esploro-csv-researcher-loader/cloudapp/src/app/main/main.component.html), no problems found



I’ve implemented the requested flow changes and aligned the docs so you can move into wiring the job orchestration next.



\## what I changed



\- Manual Entry flow (code)

&nbsp; - Added Stage 2 gating via a File Types toggle (default OFF) in main.component.html.

&nbsp;   - When OFF: hides “Next > Specify File Types” and shows “Next > Validate Entries” which skips Stage 2.

&nbsp;   - When ON: shows a callout explaining file type selection will be next and shows “Next > Specify File Types.”

&nbsp; - Introduced Stage 3 “Review \& Confirm” in main.component.ts and template:

&nbsp;   - Computes and displays counts: assets to update, total files, unique file URLs.

&nbsp;   - Actions: Back (return to Stage 1) and Run Import Job (placeholder to be wired in Phase 2).

&nbsp; - Minor additions:

&nbsp;   - `fileTypesToggle` state (default false/off).

&nbsp;   - `proceedToValidationAndReview()` to validate and compute Stage 3 counts.

&nbsp;   - `backFromReview()` navigation helper.

&nbsp;   - `runImportJob()` placeholder with an info alert for now.



\- Documentation

&nbsp; - pendingChanges.md: Added three new sections

&nbsp;   - Manual Entry – File Types Toggle Gating and Stage Routing (behavior, validation, i18n).

&nbsp;   - Stage 3 – Review \& Confirm (all input methods): counts, actions, error handling.

&nbsp;   - CSV Multi-Stage Flow: Stage 1 header detection with preview; Stage 2 mapping grid, constraints, description concatenation, choices to accept or fix invalids.

&nbsp; - explaination.md: Noted Stage 2 gating via toggle, and Stage 3 review screen after set creation/add members.



\## build status



\- Typecheck/Template check: No errors reported for main.component.ts and main.component.html.



\## what’s next



\- i18n strings

&nbsp; - Add keys referenced in the new UI:

&nbsp;   - ManualEntry.Actions.NextSpecifyTypes, ManualEntry.Actions.NextValidateEntries, ManualEntry.Stage1CalloutTypeNext

&nbsp;   - Review.Title, Review.Description, Review.AssetsCount, Review.FilesCount, Review.UniqueUrlsCount, Review.Actions.Back, Review.Actions.RunJob

\- Orchestration wiring (Phase 2)

&nbsp; - After “Next > Validate Entries” or Stage 2 completion, create set + add members, then show Stage 3 with accurate counts from the set payload.

&nbsp; - Implement Run Job: find job by ID/name, run, poll, and finally show the results component.

\- CSV UI stages (Phase 1/CSV)

&nbsp; - Implement the header detection modal and mapping grid per the updated plan.



Stage 3 (CSV)

\- Same as Manual Stage 3 (counts + confirmation to run job).



\## Phase 2: Service Layer and Orchestration (updated to include Stage 3 gate)



\- Validate assets (cache pre-state, retry invalids).

\- Create set → Add members.

\- Pause for Stage 3 (Review \& Confirm)

  - Compute counts (assets, total files, unique URLs).

  - If user confirms, continue; otherwise allow tweak and retry.

\- Find job ID (verify hardcoded ID matches name; fallback to search).

\- Run job → Poll instance (backoff, timeout, cancel).

\- Verify results:

  - Compare counters and optionally perform pre/post compare on outliers.

\- Present final report (success/failure breakdown, deep links).



Error handling remains robust across each step; partial failures are reconciled with options to retry add members or return to earlier stages.



\## Phase 4: Bulk URL Update and URL Validation (unchanged in scope, aligned to Stage 3)



\- File-to-Group subtab mirrors Manual File-to-Asset Stage 1 behavior:

  - Paste IDs (parser extracts IDs), supply one or more URLs, optional Title/Description/Supplemental, File Types toggle default OFF.

  - Duplicate Asset ID + URL detection; optional URL validation pre-check.

  - Flows into Stage 3 after set creation/add members → confirm → run job.

\- URL Validation service:

  - HEAD (fallback GET) with concurrency limits and timeouts.

  - Aggregate outcomes, allow gating submission on failures.



\## Quality gates and acceptance



\- Manual:

  - File Types toggle default OFF; correct button visibility/labels; callout visible only when ON.

  - Stage 2 only reachable when File Types toggle is ON.

  - Stage 3 always presented after set+members with correct counts and back/confirm actions.

\- CSV:

  - Header detection prompt with accurate preview, naming as Column\_# when no header.

  - Mapping constraints enforced; description concatenation preview correct and truncated.

  - Valid/invalid summary; ability to accept-as-is or edit invalids in Manual-like UI.

  - Stage 3 review appears correctly with accurate counts.

I wired the new manual-entry flow into the UI and translations so the File Types toggle now gates Stage 2, Stage 3 shows a live count summary, and running the “Run Import Job” action still queues files via the existing submission logic.



\## actions taken



\- Updated main.component.ts

&nbsp; - Added Stage 3 state, counts, and toggle-aware logic (`fileTypesToggle`, review counters, `proceedToValidationAndReview`, `runImportJob` now calls the existing `executeSubmission`).

&nbsp; - When the toggle is OFF, default file types are auto-assigned (with failure messaging) before Stage 3; if ON, we enforce per-row file type selection.

&nbsp; - Stage 3 summary counts (assets/files/unique URLs) are computed from the submission payload.



\- Updated main.component.html

&nbsp; - Added a chip-based toggle row (Asset ID/File URL locked, File Type toggle).

&nbsp; - Callout now displays only when the toggle is ON, with new translation text.

&nbsp; - Stage 1 shows “Next > Validate Entries” when the toggle is OFF, “Next > Specify File Types” when ON.

&nbsp; - Stage 2 button now routes through the new validation/review path.

&nbsp; - Added a Stage 3 review card section with Back/Run Job buttons (the Run button reuses existing submission flow for now).



\- Updated en.json

&nbsp; - Added strings for the new buttons, callout, and Stage 3 (“Review \& Confirm”) section.



\- Validation: Checked TypeScript/template errors—none reported.



\## impact \& next steps



\- Manual entry still queues files successfully; users now get a Stage 3 confirmation with counts before triggering the queue (future orchestration can hook in here).

\- CSV flow and other functionality remain untouched for now.

\- Follow-up opportunities:

&nbsp; - Add i18n-driven helper text for the toggle row.

&nbsp; - Implement the Phase 2 orchestration inside `runImportJob` (create set, add members, launch/poll job).

&nbsp; - Build the CSV Stage 1/2 header-mapping UI described in the plan.



\## quality gates

\- Build/Lint/Tests: not run (data extraction only).



\## requirements coverage

\- Deliver full job list → \*\*Done\*\* (CSV generated and entire list shared inline).



faaizhipa: Given the current architecture of the app, please verify which part fo the plan below is yet to be implemented into the app:

"You are an expert software engineer specializing in Angular and the Ex Libris Cloud App ecosystem. Your mission is to execute a major refactoring of the Esploro CSV Asset Loader application. You will overhaul the manual entry UI, implement a sophisticated, multi-step API workflow to fully automate the process of creating a set and running the import job, and enhance the app's validation and reporting capabilities.



Plan of Action

Phase 1: UI and Logic Refactoring for Manual Entry (main.component.ts \& main.component.html)

Implement Multi-Row Stage 1 UI:



On the "Manual Entry" tab, replace the existing form with a dynamic, row-based interface.

Each row will represent a single file to be added and must contain input fields for: Asset ID, Title, URL, Description, and a dropdown for Supplemental (true/false).

Initially, display one row.

Add an "Add another row" button that dynamically adds a new, identical row to the form.

Add a "Delete" button to each row to allow for its removal.

Add a "Validate \& Proceed" button to submit the data from all rows to the next stage.

Implement Stage 2 UI (File Type Selection):



After the user clicks "Validate \& Proceed," the application will enter Stage 2.

In this stage, display each entry from Stage 1, but now include a File Type dropdown for each.

This dropdown will be populated with valid file types based on the asset's type, which will be fetched in the background.

Refactor CSV Tab UI:



Ensure the "CSV Upload" tab is distinct.

Add a "Download Template CSV" button to this tab, which provides users with a pre-formatted CSV file.

The button for uploading a file should be clearly labeled, for example, "Load CSV File".

Phase 2: Service Layer and API Orchestration (asset.service.ts and new services as needed)

Implement Core API Methods:



getAsset(assetId): Fetches asset details from GET /esploro/v1/assets/{assetId}.

createSet(payload): Creates a new set using POST /conf/sets.

updateSetMembers(setId, memberIds): Adds assets to a set using POST /conf/sets/{setId}/members.

getJobDetails(jobId): Fetches details for a specific job from GET /conf/jobs/{jobId}.

findJobByName(jobName): Implements logic to search all jobs (handling pagination with offset) using GET /conf/jobs to find a job ID by its name (e.g., "Import Research Assets Files").

runJob(jobId, setId): Executes a job for a given set using POST /conf/jobs/{jobId}/instances.

getJobInstance(jobId, instanceId): Polls for job status using GET /conf/jobs/{jobId}/instances/{instanceId}.

Develop the Automated Workflow Logic: This will be the core of the new functionality, triggered after user input is validated.



Step 1: Validate Assets: For all unique asset IDs from the user's input (manual or CSV), call getAsset() to fetch their type and initial file list. Store this data. Report any non-existent assets to the user.

Step 2: Create Set: Call createSet() to create a new, temporary set for this operation. Store the returned set\_id.

Step 3: Add Members to Set: Call updateSetMembers() with the new set\_id and the list of valid asset IDs. Verify that all assets were added successfully.

Step 4: Find the Import Job ID:

First, attempt to use the hardcoded ID M50762 by calling getJobDetails(). Verify the job's name is "Import Research Assets Files".

If that fails, execute the fallback: call findJobByName() to search for the job ID.

Step 5: Run the Job: Call runJob() with the discovered job\_id and the set\_id. Store the returned instance\_id.

Step 6: Monitor Job Progress: Implement a polling mechanism that calls getJobInstance() periodically until the job status is "COMPLETED\_SUCCESS", "COMPLETED\_FAILED", or another terminal state.

Step 7: Process and Verify Results:

Once the job is complete, parse the counter array from the job instance response.

Compare the counts (file\_uploaded, asset\_succeeded, asset\_failed, etc.) with the initial counts of files and assets the user intended to process.

If there are discrepancies, perform a final verification by calling getAsset() for each failed or partially successful asset and compare its final file list against the initial file list to pinpoint the exact failures.

Step 8: Display Final Report: Present a comprehensive summary to the user in the ProcessingResultsComponent, including successes, failures, and specific error messages from the job report.

Phase 3: Documentation Updates (README.md \& explaination.md)

Update README.md:



Thoroughly document the new multi-row, two-stage manual entry workflow.

Explain the purpose of the "Download Template CSV" button.

Update explaination.md:



Revise the "Data Flow" section and Mermaid diagrams to illustrate the new, complex API orchestration sequence (Validate -> Create Set -> Add Members -> Find Job -> Run Job -> Monitor -> Verify).

Update the "APIs and Payloads" section to include all the new endpoints being used.

Document the before-and-after asset file comparison as the definitive method for verifying success.

Execute these tasks methodically. The new API orchestration logic is complex and should be developed with robust error handling at every step. Refer to the provided documentation for API schemas and best practices. #file:example-api-response  #file:documentation
