## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can rollback:

### Option 1: Git Revert
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>

```

### Option 2: Previous Build
```bash
git checkout <previous-tag>

### Option 3: Feature Flag (Future)
Consider implementing a feature flag to toggle CSV upload:
```typescript
// In component
showCSVTab = environment.enableCSVUpload;
```
